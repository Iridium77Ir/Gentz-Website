To use this website add a ".env" file: 

PORT=?(Number ex: 3006)
ADMIN_USER="?"
ADMIN_PASS="?"
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://?/?"
COOKIE_SECRET="?" (Just a random string of random length you have to insert)

And add a "press.md", "intro.md" and "contact.md" file to the /routes/cp folder. (They are now already included)
